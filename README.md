# Homework due on 11th September 2017
* Use Sage Graphics to draw Pascal's triangle (something like the image below), but up to 32 rows, with each odd number in red, and each even number in blue.

	You may put your code in a jupyter workseet with filename ``pascal.ipynb``, or in a code file named ``pascal.sage``


* Construct an animation demonstrating the convergence of the successive partial sums of the power series for ``exp(x)``:
$$ f_n(x) = 1 + \frac{x}{1!} + \frac{x^2}{2!} + \dotsb + \frac{x^n}{n!}$$
to f(x). Something like the following image:

You may put your code in a jupyter workseet with filename ``exp.ipynb``, or in a code file named ``exp.sage``
